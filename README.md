# About me

**Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Vinicius Carmo!**

I am a MSc student at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, under the computer engineering department. My topic of research is Question Answering Systems, and it involves a lot of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, specially Deep Leaning. 

I try to always write in English, but some content are targeted to Brazilian audience, so they will be in Portuguese.

## My toy projects

### Mapa da EducaÃ§Ã£o no Brasil (Brazilian Education Map)

Visualization is a powerful tool to explore large amounts of data. This project created a visualization that allows you to interact with statistics about the quality of the education in brazil obtained from the ENEM 2018 data. 

ENEM is a test almost every Brazilian student takes after high school to enter the university. It is like the SAT exam on the United States. They release microdata with grades and social-economic information about all students that sign up for the exam. 

You can check the visualization created on [GitHub Pages](https://vinicius-cleves.github.io/enem/visualization/). There you can interact with the map and observe the distribution of student performance by subject, type of school, region and income.


### Brasil em Chamas (Brazil on Fire)

Brazil is facing a growing number of devastation by wildfires. By the time of writing, only in Pantanal (Brazilian wetlands), more than 23,000 km2 were burned just on 2020. This number doesn't provide a clear picture of how much it represents, though, especially for people that are not a number person. 

In order to offer people a clear dimension of the ongoing tragedy this devastation represents, I built a [website](https://vinicius-cleves.github.io/brasil-em-chamas/) where users can select a point on Brazil's map and it will mark a region around that point with area equivalent to the one destroyed on Pantanal.

I plan to include more options on this website soon, like the area devastated on other ecosystems. 

### Portugal em Chamas (Portugal on Fire)

This is a spin-off from [Brazil em Chamas](#brasil-em-chamas). It is a joint effort with the collaborators from [JEST](http://www.jest.pt/), a Junior Enterprise from the University of Coimbra.
